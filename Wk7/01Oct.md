# Probability (contd.)
## Probability Mass Function
If $X$ is a random variable with countable range. The function
$$P_X(x_k) = P(X = x_k)$$
is called the probability mass function (PMF) or probability distribution.

## Expectation
The expected value of a random variable $X$ is defined as
$$E[X] = \sum_k P(x_k) \cdot x_k.$$

The expected value satisfies
$$E[aX+b] = aE[X] + b.$$
